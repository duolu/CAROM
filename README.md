# CAROM

CAROM means "CARs On the Map". It is a framework to track and localize vehicles using monocular traffic monitoring cameras on road infrastructures. The tracking results can be stored in files or in a database as records. Using the results, a traffic scene can be reconstructed and replayed on a map. See the following [demo video](https://youtu.be/74UEiJJNEXo) and a preprint version of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00893).

Through collaborating with a local transportation department in the United States, we constructed a benchmarking dataset containing GPS data, roadside camera videos, and drone videos to validate the vehicle tracking results. On average, the localization error is approximately 0.8 m and 1.7 m on average within the range of 50 m and 120 m from the cameras, respectively. More detailed demo videos for qualitative evaluation are shown as follows.
